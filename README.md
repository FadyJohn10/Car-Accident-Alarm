# Car-Accident-Alarm

Project overview:

Our project is designed to help improve the safety of drivers on the road by alerting them when they are not in the correct position and providing them. The M5Stack is a compact, easy-to-use device that is used for this project idea. By continually monitoring the angle of the driver's head, our project can detect when the driver is not in the correct position. When this happens, the M5Stack initiates a series of reactions to alert the driver and help them correct their posture. The first reaction is to display a message on a red screen, informing the driver that they are not in the correct position. The second reaction is to display a beep sound that is intended to catch the driver's attention and alert them to the fact that they need to correct their posture. The third reaction is to initiate vibrations in the M5Stack, which provide a physical sensation that can help to further alert the driver. Additionally, our project also sends a report to the driver's email, providing them with insights on their driving performance. This report includes information about the percentage of time the driver spent in the correct position.
